/*  PROBLEM:
    Given an array of n numbers and a positive integer k. 
    The problem is to find k numbers with most occurrences, 
    i.e., the top k numbers having the maximum frequency. 
    If two numbers have same frequency then the larger number 
    should be given preference. The numbers should be displayed 
    in decreasing order of their frequencies. It is assumed that 
    the array consists of k numbers with most occurrences.

    SOLUTION:

    Method 1: Use Hashing
    Using hash table, we create a frequency table which stores 
    the frequency of occurrence of each number in the given array. 
    In the hash table we define (x, y) tuple, where x is the 
    key (number) and y is its frequency in the array. Now we 
    traverse this hash table and create an array freq_arr[] which 
    stores these (number, frequency) tuples. Sort this freq_arr[] 
    on the basis of the conditions defined in the problem statement. 
    Now, print the first k numbers of this freq_arr[].

    Time Complexity: O(d*logd) and Space Complexity: O(d) where
    d is the number of distinct elements.

    Method 2: Use Heap
    We create a frequency table which stores the frequency of occurrence 
    of each number in the given array. In the hash table we define (x, y) tuple, 
    where x is the key (number) and y is its frequency in the array. 
    Now we traverse this hash table and create an array freq_arr[] which stores 
    these (number, frequency) tuples. Sort this freq_arr[] on the basis of the 
    conditions defined in the problem statement. Now, print the first k numbers 
    of this freq_arr[].

    Time Complexity: O(k*logd) and Space Complexity: O(d) where
    d is the number of distinct elements.

    Both the methods have been implemented below.
