/*  Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear 
    ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge uv, vertex
    u comes before v in the ordering. Topological Sorting for a graph 
    is not possible if the graph is not a DAG.

    We can modify DFS to find Topological Sorting of a graph. In DFS, 
    we start from a vertex, we first print it and then recursively call 
    DFS for its adjacent vertices. In topological sorting, we use a 
    temporary stack. We donâ€™t print the vertex immediately, we first 
    recursively call topological sorting for all its adjacent vertices, 
    then push it to a stack. Finally, print contents of stack. 
    Note that a vertex is pushed to stack only when all of its adjacent 
    vertices (and their adjacent vertices and so on) are already in stack.
