/*  PROBLEM:
    Given a graph, the task is to find if it has a cycle 
    of odd length or not.

    SOLUTION:
    The idea is based on an important fact that a graph 
    does not contain a cycle of odd length if and only if 
    it is Bipartite, i.e., it can be colored with two colors.

    It is obvious that if a graph has an odd length cycle 
    then it cannot be Bipartite. In Bipartite graph there 
    are two sets of vertices such that no vertex in a set 
    is connected with any other vertex of the same set). 
    For a cycle of odd length, two vertices must of the same 
    set be connected which contradicts Bipartite definition.

    Below is code to check if a graph has odd cycle or not. 
    The code basically checks whether graph is Bipartite.

    color[0] = 1;
    // Create a queue for BFS traversal
    queue<int> q;
    q.push(0);
    while (!q.empty()) {
        int u = q.front();
        q.pop();
        // Return true if there is a self loop
        for (int i = 0; i < graph[u].size(); i++)
            if (graph[u][i] == u)
                return true;
