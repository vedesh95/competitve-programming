/*  PROBLEM:
    Given an undirected and connected graph and a number n, 
    count total number of cycles of length n in the graph.

    SOLUTION:
    Using DFS we find every possible path of length (n-1) for 
    a particular source (or starting point). Then we check if 
    this path ends with the vertex it started with, if yes 
    then we count this as the cycle of length n. Notice that we 
    looked for path of length (n-1) because the nth edge will 
    be the closing edge of cycle.

    Every possible path of length (n-1) can be searched using only 
    V – (n – 1) vertices (where V is the total number of vertices).

    For example, consider the following graph:
    V = 5 and E = 6
    Edges are: 0 - 1, 1 - 2, 2 - 3, 3 - 4, 3 - 0 and 4 - 1.

    Total cycles of length 4 = 3. The cycles are:
    
        0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 0
        0 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 0
        1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1
    
    For above example, all the cycles of length 4 can be searched using 
    only 5-(4-1) = 2 vertices. The reason behind this is quite simple, 
    because we search for all possible path of length (n-1) = 3 using 
    these 2 vertices which include the remaining 3 vertices. So, these 
    2 vertices cover the cycles of remaining 3 vertices as well, and
    using only 3 vertices we can’t form a cycle of length 4 anyways.

    One more thing to notice is that, every vertex finds 2 duplicate 
    cycles for every cycle that it forms. For above example 0th vertex 
    finds two duplicate cycle namely 0 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0 and 
    0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 0. Hence the total count must be divided by 2 
    because every cycle is counted twice.
