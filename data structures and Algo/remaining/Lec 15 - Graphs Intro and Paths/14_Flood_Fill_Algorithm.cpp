/*  Flood fill algorithm can be simply modeled as graph traversal problem, 
    representing the given area as a matrix and considering every cell of 
    that matrix as a vertex that is connected to points above it, below it, 
    to right of it, and to left of it and in case of 8-connections, to the 
    points at both diagonals also.

    In general, any cell (x, y) is connected to (x-1, y-1), (x-1, y), (x-1, y+1),
    (x, y-1), (x, y+1), (x+1, y-1), (x+1, y), (x+1, y+1). Of course, boundary
    conditions are to be kept in mind.

    This area now can be modelled as a graph. For (x,y) cell, all possible 8 
    neighbours are its adjacent cells. So DFS or BFS can be used to traverse
    the graph. The pseudocode for DFS is :

    function DFS(x, y, visited, n, m):
        if (x ≥ n OR y ≥ m)
            return
        if(x < 0 OR y < 0)
            return
        if(visisted[x][y] == True)
            return
        visited[x][y] = True
        DFS(x-1, y-1, visited, n, m)
        DFS(x-1, y, visited, n, m)
        DFS(x-1, y+1, visited, n, m)
        DFS(x, y-1, visited, n, m)
        DFS(x, y+1, visited, n, m)
        DFS(x+1, y-1, visited, n, m)
        DFS(x+1, y, visited, n, m)
        DFS(x+1, y+1, visited, n, m)

    The above code visits each and every cell of matrix of size n x m.
    Time Complexity: O(n*m)

    One important use of Flood Fill Algorithm is to solve a matrix maze.
    Lets implement the algorithm below by solving the following question:

    PROBLEM: 
    A maze is represented by a matrix of size N x M, where rows are 
    numbered from 1 to N and columns are numbered from 1 to M.
    Each cell of a matrix can be either 0 or 1. If a cell is 0, that
    cell cannot be visited and if it is 1, it can be visited. Allowed
    moves are U(up), D(down), L(left), R(right). Find a path from cell 
    (1, 1) to (N, M) given that the source and destination cells always 
    have value 1. If there is no path, print -1.
