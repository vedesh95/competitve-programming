/*  A Bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided
    into two independent sets, U and V, such that every edge
    connects a vertex from U to V or a vertex from V to U.
    In other words no edge connects the vertices belonging to 
    same set.

    A bipartite graph is possible if the graph coloring is possible 
    using two colors such that vertices in a set are colored with 
    the same color. 

    Note: A graph represented by hexagon is bipartite but a graph
    represented by pentagon is not bipartite. 

    Algorithm:
    
    We will consider two colors: 0(RED) and 1(BLUE). The visited array
    will be an integer array, with every element initialized as -1.
    While we visit every node, we will assign that node either RED or BLUE.
    1. Assign RED color to the source vertex (putting into set U).
    2. Color all the neighbors with BLUE color (putting into set V).
    3. Color all neighborâ€™s neighbor with RED color (putting into set U).
    4. This way, assign color to all vertices such that it satisfies all 
       the constraints of m way coloring problem where m = 2.
    5. While assigning colors, if we find a neighbor which is colored with 
       same color as current vertex, then the graph cannot be colored with 
       2 vertices (or graph is not Bipartite)
    
    In above code, we always start with source 0 and assume that vertices 
    are visited from it. One important observation is a graph with no edges 
    is also Bipartite.
