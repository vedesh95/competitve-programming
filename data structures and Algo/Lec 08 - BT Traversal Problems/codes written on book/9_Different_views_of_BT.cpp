/*  There are total 4 views of BT:
    a) Left View:
        The left view of the following tree:
                1
               / \
              2   3
            /  \ /  \
           7   6 5   4
        
        is: 1 2 7

        It seems like printing the leftboundary but it's different.
        For example, for the following tree:
                4
               / \
              5    2
                  / \
                 3   1
                / \
               6   7

        Left boundary is: 4 5
        But the Left View is: 4 5 3 6

    We can keep track of level of a node by passing a parameter 
    to all recursive calls. The idea is to keep track of maximum 
    level also. Whenever we see a node whose level is more than 
    maximum level so far, we print the node because this is the 
    first node in its level.

    b) Right View:
        The right view of above tree is: 4 2 1

    We can keep track of level of a node by passing a parameter 
    to all recursive calls. The idea is to keep track of maximum 
    level also. And traverse the tree in a manner that right subtree 
    is visited before left subtree. Whenever we see a node whose 
    level is more than maximum level so far, we print the node 
    because this is the last node in its level. Note we traverse
    right subtree first in this case and then left subtree.

    c) Top View:
        The top view of above tree is: 5 4 2 1

    Like vertical Order Traversal, we need to put nodes of same horizontal 
    distance together. We do a level order traversal so that the topmost 
    node at a horizontal node is visited before any other node of same 
    horizontal distance below it. Hashing is used to check if a node at 
    given horizontal distance is seen or not.

    d) Bottom View:
        The bottom view of above tree is: 5 6 3 7 1
    
    If there are multiple bottom-most nodes for a horizontal distance from root, 
    then print the later one in level traversal. For example, in the below diagram, 
    3 and 4 are both the bottom-most nodes at horizontal distance 0, 
    we need to print 4.
                   
                      20
                    /    \
                  8       22
                /   \    /   \
              5      3 4     25
                    / \      
                  10   14 
    Output: 5 10 4 14 25

    Create a map like, map where key is the horizontal distance and value 
    is a pair(a, b) where a is the value of the node and b is the height 
    of the node. Perform a pre-order traversal of the tree. If the current
    node at a horizontal distance of h is the first weâ€™ve seen, insert it 
    in the map. Otherwise, compare the node with the existing one in map 
    and if the height of the new node is greater, update in the Map.

    Following is the code to print different views of BT.
    We have not implemented right view function, as it is
    just the modification of left view function.
