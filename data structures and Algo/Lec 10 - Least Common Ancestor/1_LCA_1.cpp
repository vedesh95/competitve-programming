/*  PROBLEM:
    Given a binary tree and two values say n1 and n2, 
    write a program to find the least common ancestor.

    The lowest common ancestor between two nodes n1 and n2 
    is defined as the lowest node in T that has both n1 and n2 
    as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant 
    of itself).

    Method 1 - By storing root to n1 and root to n2 paths
    
    1. Find path from root to n1 and store it in a array
    2. Find path from root to n2 and store it in another array
    3. Traverse both the paths till the values in array are same
       Return the common element just before the mismatch
    
    Time Complexity: O(n)
