/*  
    Method 2 - Using single traversal

    Method 1 requires 3 tree traversals plus extra spaces for 
    path arrays. In this method we will find LCA without
    extra space and in single traversal. 

    The idea is to traverse the tree starting from root. If
    any of the given keys (n1 and n2) matches with root, then
    root is LCA. If root doesn't match with any of the nodes,
    we recurr for left and right subtree. The node which has 
    one key present in its left subtree and the other key 
    present in right subtree is the LCA. If both keys lie in 
    left subtree, then left subtree has LCA also, otherwise 
    LCA lies in right subtree.

    Time complexity of the above solution is O(n) as the method 
    does a simple tree traversal in bottom up fashion.

/*  ADDITIONAL POINT:

    Note that the above method assumes that keys are present 
    in Binary Tree. If one key is present and other is absent, 
    then it returns the present key as LCA.
    (Ideally should have returned NULL). We can extend this 
    method to handle all cases by passing two boolean variables 
    v1 and v2. v1 is set as true when n1 is present in tree 
    and v2 is set as true if n2 is present in tree.
