/*  PROBLEM:
    Given a singly linked list, rotate the linked list 
    counter-clockwise by k nodes. 

    ALGORITHM:
    1. To rotate the linked list, we need to 
       - change next of kth node to NULL
       - change next of the last node to the previous head node
       - change head to (k+1)th node. 
       So we need to get hold of three nodes: kth node, (k+1)th node and last node.

    2. Traverse the list from the beginning and stop at kth node. 
       Store pointer to kth node. We can get (k+1)th node using kthNode->next. 
       Keep traversing till the end and store pointer to last node also. 
       Finally, change pointers as stated above.

    // If current is NULL that means 'k' is
    // greater than the size of the list

        current = current->next;
    
    // Change next of the last node to the head
    current->next = *head_ref;

    // Change head of (k+1)th node 
    *head_ref = kthNode->next;
