/* Write a function detectAndRemoveLoop() that checks whether a given Linked List 
   contains loop and if loop is present then removes the loop and returns true.

Method 1: Based on 'Tortoise and Hare Technique'

                                                    (Meeting point)
                                          --- (k nodes) --- * ---------
                                        /                               \
    * --------- (m nodes) ----------- *                                  |
 (start)           (beginning of loop)  \                               /
                                          ------ (n nodes in loop) ----
    Explanation:
        Let m = number of nodes before the loop has begun,
            k = number of nodes from beginning point where fast and slow will meet
            n = total length of the loop

        Now,  Distance travelled by fast = 2*Distance travelled by slow
        Hence,  m + n*x + k = 2*(m + n*y + k)   where
            x = number of cycles completed by fast pointer before first meet
            y = number of cycles completed by slow pointer before first meet
        
        Solving, m + k = (x - 2y)*n

        This shows, (m + k) is multiple of n. So once they meet, if the slow
        starts from head and fast starts from k with SAME PACE now, they will 
        meet at the beginning of loop. This is because, 'slow' has covered m steps
        and has reached at the beginning of loop, 'fast' has also covered m steps
        and has already started k steps in advance (covering m+k steps in total).
        Since m+k is multiple of n, 'fast' has to be at the start of loop.

        Now once we are at start of loop, we get the pointer of the last node and 
        its next as NULL. 

Method 2: Use Hashing
    We can hash the addresses of the linked list nodes in an unordered set and just 
    check if the element already exists in the map. If it exists, we have reached a 
    node which already exists by a cycle, hence we need to make the last nodeâ€™s next 
    pointer NULL.
