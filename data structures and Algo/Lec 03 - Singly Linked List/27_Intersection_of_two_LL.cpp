/*  PROBLEM: 
    There are two singly linked lists in a system. By some programming error, 
    the end node of one of the linked list got linked to the second list, 
    forming an inverted Y shaped list. Write a program to get the point
    where two linked list merge.

    Approach 1 - Using Two Loops
    Use 2 nested for loops. The outer loop will be for each node of the 1st list 
    and inner loop will be for 2nd list. In the inner loop, check if any of nodes 
    of the 2nd list is same as the current node of the first linked list. 
    Time complexity: O(M * N) where M and N are the numbers of nodes in two lists.
    Space complexity: O(1)

    Approach 2 - Use difference of node counts
    1. Get the count of nodes in the first list. Let it be c1.
    2. Get the count of nodes in the second list. Let it be c2.
    3. Get difference d = abs(c1-c2)
    4. Traverse d nodes in the bigger list.
    5. Then we can traverse both the lists in parallel till we come across a common node. 
       (Note that getting a common node is done by comparing the address of the nodes.)
    Time complexity: O(M+N) and Space Complexity: O(1)

    We have implemented approach 2 in the following code.
