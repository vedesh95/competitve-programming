/*  If we are allowed extra space, then we can simply move all 
    items of queue to an array, then sort the array and finally 
    move array elements back to queue.

    Following is the idea to sort a queue with constant space:
    - On every pass on the queue, we seek for the next minimum index. 
      To do this we dequeue and enqueue elements until we find the next 
      minimum. In this operation the queue is not changed at all. 
      After we have found the minimum index, we dequeue and enqueue 
      elements from the queue except for the minimum index, after we 
      finish the traversal in the queue we insert the minimum to the 
      rear of the queue. We keep on this until all minimums are pushed 
      all way long to the front and the queue becomes sorted.

    - On every next seeking for the minimum, we exclude seeking on the 
      minimums that have already sorted.

    - We repeat this method n times.

    - At first we seek for the maximum, because on every pass we need find 
      the next minimum, so we need to compare it with the largest element 
      in the queue.
    
    Time complexity: O(n^2) and Space complexity: O(1)
