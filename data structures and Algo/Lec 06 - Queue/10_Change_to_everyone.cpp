/*  PROBLEM:
    Given an array of N integers where Ai denotes the currency 
    of note that the i-th person has. The possible currencies 
    are 5, 10 and 20. All the N people are standing in a queue 
    waiting to buy an ice-cream from X which costs Rs 5. Initially, 
    X has an initial balance of 0. 
    Check if X will be able to provide change to every people who 
    are waiting to buy an ice-cream.

    Input:a[] = {5, 5, 5, 10, 20}
    Output: YES
    -> When the fourth person chance comes to buy an ice-cream, 
    X has three Rs 5 change, hence X gives him 1, and now when the 
    fifth person comes to buy the ice-cream, X has two Rs 5 and
    one Rs 10 note, hence he gives him one Rs 10 and one Rs 5 note.

    Input: a[] = {5, 10, 10, 20}
    Output: NO

    SOLUTION:
    The approach is to keep a track of the number of Rs 5 and Rs 10 
    currencies. Rs 20 currencies will not be used since it is the 
    highest currency that a person can give and thus it cannot be 
    given as a change. Initialize two variables to count Rs 5(fiveCount) 
    and Rs 10(tenCount). If the person has a Rs 10 currency and 
    fiveCount > 0, then decrease fiveCount and increase tenCount. 
    If X does not have Rs 5, then X cannot give the person the required change. 
    If the person has 5$ note, increase fiveCount by one. If the person has a 
    Rs 20, then three conditions will be:

    - If fiveCount > 0 and tencount > 0, decrease both.
    - else if, fiveCount >= 3, decrease fivecount by three.
    - else, return false.
    
    If all the person in the queue gets the change, then print “YES” else print “NO”
