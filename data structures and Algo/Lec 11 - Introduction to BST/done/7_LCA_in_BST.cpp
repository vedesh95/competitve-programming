/*  PROBLEM:
    Given values of two values n1 and n2 in a BST, find LCA. 
    You may assume that both the values exist in the tree.

    SOLUTION:
    The main idea of the solution is, while traversing from 
    top to bottom, the first node n we encounter with value 
    between n1 and n2, i.e., n1 < n < n2 or same as one of 
    the n1 or n2, is LCA of n1 and n2 (assuming that n1 < n2). 
    
    So just recursively traverse the BST in, if node’s value 
    is greater than both n1 and n2 then our LCA lies in left 
    side of the node, if it’s is smaller than both n1 and n2, 
    then LCA lies on right side. Otherwise root is LCA 
    (assuming that both n1 and n2 are present in BST).

/*  ADDITIONAL POINT:

    The above solution requires O(h) extra space in function 
    call stack for recursive function calls. We can avoid 
    extra space using iterative solution.
