/*
    We need to delete node from CLL.
    If the list is empty we will simply return.

    If the list is not empty, then we define two pointers 'curr' and 'prev'.
    Initialize the 'curr' pointer with the head node.
    Traverse the list using 'curr' pointer and find the node to be deleted.
    Maintain a 'prev' node, which will be previous to 'curr' pointer at any time.
    - If the node is found, check if it's the only node in the list.
      If yes, set head = NULL and delete curr.
    - If the list has more than one node, check if it is the first node of the list.
      If yes, then move the prev pointer to last node. Then, 
        head = head->next   and     prev->next = head.  Delete curr.
    - If curr is not first node, we check if it is the last node in the list.
      If yes, set   prev->next = head   and     delete curr.
    - If node to be deleted is neither the first node and nor the last node, 
      set   prev->next = temp->next     and     delete curr.
