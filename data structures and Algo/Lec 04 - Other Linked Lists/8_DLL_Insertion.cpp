/*  A Doubly Linked List (DLL) contains an extra pointer, 
    typically called previous pointer, together with next pointer 
    and data which are there in singly linked list.

    Advantages over singly linked list
    1) A DLL can be traversed in both forward and backward direction.
    2) The delete operation in DLL is more efficient if pointer to 
       the node to be deleted is given.
    3) We can quickly insert a new node before a given node.
    
    In singly linked list, to delete a node, pointer to the previous 
    node is needed. To get this previous node, sometimes the list is 
    traversed. In DLL, we can get the previous node using previous pointer.

    Disadvantages over singly linked list
    1) Every node of DLL Require extra space for an previous pointer.
       However it is possible to implement with single pointer only.
       (This is discussed in 15_Memory_efficient_DLL.cpp)
    2) All operations require an extra pointer previous to be maintained. 
       Due to this, task of fixing links becomes little cumbersome.

    
    A node can be added in a DLL in three ways:
    1) At the front of the DLL
    2) After a given node
    3) At the end of the DLL

    We have mentioned steps in the comments of code.
