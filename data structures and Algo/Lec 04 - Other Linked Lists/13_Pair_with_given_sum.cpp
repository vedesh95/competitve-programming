/*  PROBLEM:
    Given a sorted doubly linked list of positive distinct 
    elements, the task is to find pairs in doubly linked list 
    whose sum is equal to given value x

    Input : head : 1 <-> 2 <-> 4 <-> 5 <-> 6 <-> 8 <-> 9 and x = 7
    Output: (6, 1), (5,2)

    SOLUTION:

    1. Initialize two pointer variables to find the candidate elements 
       in the sorted doubly linked list.Initialize first with start of 
       doubly linked list i.e; first=head and initialize second with 
       last node of doubly linked list i.e; second=last_node.
    2. We initialize first and second pointers as first and last nodes. 
       Here we don’t have random access, so to find second pointer, we 
       traverse the list to initialize second.
    3. If current sum of first and second is less than x, then we move 
       first in forward direction. If current sum of first and second 
       element is greater than x, then we move second in backward direction.
    4. Loop termination conditions are also different from arrays. The loop 
       terminates when either of two pointers become NULL, or they cross each 
       other (second->next = first), or they become same (first == second).
