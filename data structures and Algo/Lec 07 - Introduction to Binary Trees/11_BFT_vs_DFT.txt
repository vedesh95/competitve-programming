A Tree is typically traversed in two ways:
    -Breadth First Traversal (Or Level Order Traversal)
    -Depth First Traversals
        * Inorder Traversal (Left-Root-Right)
        * Preorder Traversal (Root-Left-Right)
        * Postorder Traversal (Left-Right-Root)
    
How to decide which way of traversal is better? BFT or DFT?

1.  There are many tree questions that can be solved using any of the above four traversals. 
    Examples of such questions are size of tree, maximum element, minimum element, etc.

2.  All four traversals require O(n) time as they visit every node exactly once.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So where does the difference come? 

1.  There is difference in terms of extra space required.

    Extra Space required for DFT is O(w) where w is maximum width of BT. 
    In BFT, queue one by one stores nodes of different level.

    Extra Space required for DFT is O(h) where h is maximum height of BT. 
    In DFT, stack (or function call stack) stores all ancestors of a node.

    Maximum Width of a BT at depth (or height) h can be 2^h where h starts from 0. 
    So the maximum number of nodes can be at the last level. 
    And worst case occurs when BT is a perfect BT with numbers of nodes like 1, 3, 7, 15, …etc. 
    In worst case, value of 2^h is Ceil(n/2). Height for a Balanced BT is O(Log n). Worst case 
    occurs for skewed tree and worst case height becomes O(n). 
    
    So in worst case extra space required is O(n) for both. But worst cases occur for different 
    types of trees.

    It is evident from above points that extra space required for DFT is likely to be more when 
    tree is more balanced and extra space for Depth First Traversal is likely to be more when tree 
    is less balanced.

2.  Another point of difference is - BFS starts visiting nodes from root while DFS starts visiting 
    nodes from leaves.

    So if our problem is to search something that is more likely to closer to root, we would 
    prefer BFS. And if the target node is close to a leaf, we would prefer DFS.

    Q. Which traversal should be used to print leaves of BT?
    -> Depth First Traversal
    Q. Which traversal should be used to print nodes at k’th level where k is much less than 
       total number of levels?
    -> Breadth First Traversal
