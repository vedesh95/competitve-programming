1. FULL/STRICT Binary Tree

A Binary Tree is full if every node has 0 or 2 children. Following are examples of a full binary tree. 
We can also say a full binary tree is a binary tree in which all nodes except leaves have two children.

               18                               
             /    \                    
           15       30  
         /  \      /  \
       40    50   100  40
           /  \   
         15    20    
        /  \       
      40    50   
    /   \
   30   50

In a Full Binary Tree, number of leaf nodes is number of internal nodes plus 1.
       L = N + 1
where L = Number of leaf nodes, N = Number of internal nodes.

2. COMPLETE Binary Tree

A Binary Tree is a complete binary tree if all levels are completely filled except possibly the last
level and the last level has all keys as left as possible.

	        18
              /    \  
            15      30  
           /  \     /  \
         40    50  100  40
     	/  \   /
       8    7  9 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. PERFECT Binary Tree

A Binary Tree is a perfect binary tree if all internal nodes have two children and all leaves are at the 
same level.

	       18
           /       \  
         15         30  
        /  \        /  \
      40    50    100   40
	
A Perfect Binary Tree of height h (where height is the number of nodes on the path from the root to leaf) 
has 2^h â€“ 1 nodes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. SKEWED Binary Tree

A skewed tree is a tree where each node has only one child node or none.

Examples:

			    5
			   /   
			  4
			   \
			    3
			    /
			   2
	This is a skewed tree.

			      5
			      /
			     4
			     \
		              3
			    /  \
			   2    4
	This is not a skewed tree.
