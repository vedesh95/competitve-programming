/*  PROBLEM: Given a sorted and rotated array, find if there is 
	a pair with given sum, assuming all elements to be distinct.

	SOLUTION:
	a) Find the pivot element of the rotated array. 
	b) Use two pointers with left pointer pointing to minimum element 
	   and right pointer pointing to maximum element.
	c) Find sum of the elements pointed by both the pointers.
	   If sum is equal to x, then increment count. 
	   If sum is less than x, then move left pointer by incrementing it.
	   If sum is greater than x, then move right pointer by decrementing it.
	d) Repeat step 3 and 4 until left pointer is not equal to right pointer.
	e) Print all pairs and the count of such pairs.
