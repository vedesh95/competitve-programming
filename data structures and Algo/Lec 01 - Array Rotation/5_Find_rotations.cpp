/* PROBLEM: Given a sorted and rotated array, write a function
    which returns the number of rotations performed on sorted array.

   SOLUTION:
    Let the initial array be: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} and after
    rotations, array be: arr[] = {6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.

    We can achieve this configuration by two ways:    
    a) If the array was left_rotated, we need 5 rotations.
    b) If the array was right_rotated, we need 2 rotations.

    We can see one thing, if the index of pivot element is 'i',
    (pivot is the maximum element of the array) then - 

    No. of left rotations performed = N - i - 1
    No. of right rotations performed = i + 1

    So now our task is - to find the index of the pivot element.
    We can do this in O(logN) time by "Finding a peak."

    Peak in an array is defined as the element which is greater than
    both of its adjacent elements.

using namespace std;

// Main Logic of Code
int findPivot (int arr[], int low, int high) {
    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = low+(high-low)/2;

        // If pivot is at 'mid'
        if (mid < high && arr[mid] > arr[mid+1])
            return mid;
        
        // If pivot is at 'mid-1'
        if (mid > low && arr[mid] < arr[mid-1])
            return mid-1;
        
        if (arr[low] >= arr[mid])
            high = mid-1;
        else
            low = mid+1;
    }
    // If reached here, it means array is not at all rotated
    return -1;
