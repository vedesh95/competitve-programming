/*  We know that we cannot construct a unique BT from
    only its pre and post order traversals. We need some
    additional information. One such additional information
    could be - the type of BT.

    PROBLEM:
    Given two arrays that represent preorder and postorder 
    traversals of a full binary tree, construct the binary tree.
    Remember a Full Binary Tree is a binary tree where every 
    node has either 0 or 2 children.

    SOLUTION:
    Let us consider the two given arrays as 
    pre[] = {1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 5, 3, 6, 7} and 
    post[] = {8, 9, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 3, 1};

    In pre[], the leftmost element is root of tree. Since the tree 
    is full and array size is more than 1. The value next to 1 in 
    pre[], must be left child of root. So we know 1 is root and 2 
    is left child. How to find the all nodes in left subtree? 
    
    We know 2 is root of all nodes in left subtree. All nodes before 
    2 in post[] must be in left subtree. Now we know 1 is root, 
    elements {8, 9, 4, 5, 2} are in left subtree, and the 
    elements {6, 7, 3} are in right subtree.

                      1
                    /   \
    {8, 9, 4, 5, 2}     {6, 7, 3}

    We recursively follow the above approach and get the following tree.

                  1
                /   \
               2     3
             /  \   /  \
            4    5 6    7
           / \  
          8   9

        this->left = this->right = NULL;
    }

    if (node == NULL)

    // node at preIndex from preorder, make it root and
    // increment preIndex
    Node* root = new Node(pre[*preIndex]);
    (*preIndex)++;

    // If the current subarray has only 1 element left, no need to recurr
    if (l == h) return root;

    // Search the next element of pre[] in post[]  
    int i;  
    for (i = l; i <= h; ++i)  
        if (pre[*preIndex] == post[i])

    // array in two parts - left and right subtree

        root->left = constructTreeUtil(pre, post, preIndex, l, i, size);
        root->right = constructTreeUtil(pre, post, preIndex, i+1, h, size);
    }
    return root;
}

    int preIndex = 0;
    return constructTreeUtil(pre, post, &preIndex, 0, size-1, size);

int main ()  
{  
    int pre[] = {1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 5, 3, 6, 7};  
    int post[] = {8, 9, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 3, 1};  
    int size = sizeof( pre ) / sizeof( pre[0] );  
  
    Node *root = constructTree(pre, post, size);  
  
    cout << "Inorder traversal of the constructed tree: \n";  
    printInorder(root);  
  
    return 0;  
} 

/*  ADDITIONAL POINT:
    Given two arrays that represent Preorder traversals of a 
    full binary tree and its mirror tree, we need to write a 
    program to construct the binary tree using these two Preorder 
    traversals.

    Input : preOrder[] = {1,2,4,5,3,6,7}
            preOrderMirror[] = {1,3,7,6,2,5,4}

    Output :          1
                    /    \
                   2      3
                 /   \   /  \
                4     5 6    7
    

    SOLUTION:
    Notice carefully, the reverese of the preorder traversal of the
    mirror tree is the postorder traversal of original tree.

    We can now construct the tree from preorder and postorder traversals
    as above.
