/* PROBLEM:
    How to implement a stack which will support following operations in O(1) time complexity?
        1) push() which adds an element to the top of stack.
        2) pop() which removes an element from top of stack.
        3) findMiddle() which will return middle element of the stack.
        4) deleteMiddle() which will delete the middle element. 

    SOLUTION:
    The important question is, whether to use linked list or array implementation of stack?
    We need to find and delete middle element. Deleting an element from middle is not O(1) 
    for array. Also, we may need to move the middle pointer up when we push an element and 
    move down when we pop(). In singly linked list, moving middle pointer in both directions 
    is not possible.

    The idea is to use Doubly Linked List (DLL). We can delete middle element in O(1) time 
    by maintaining mid pointer. We can move mid pointer in both directions using previous 
    and next pointers.
