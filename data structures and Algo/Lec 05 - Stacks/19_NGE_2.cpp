/* In the previous question's output, you can see that the elements
   printed in output are not in same order as that of input. 

   So solve the previous question - but the next greater elements 
   should be printed in same order as input array.

   SOLUTION:
    Here we traverse array from rightmost element.

    1. In this approach we have started iterating from the last 
       element(nth) to the first(1st) element. The benefit is that 
       when we arrive at a certain index his next greater element 
       will be already in stack and we can directly get this element 
       while at the same index.

    2. After reaching a certain index we will pop the stack till we 
       get the greater element on top from the current element and 
       that element will be the answer for current element.

    3. If stack gets empty while doing the pop operation then the 
       answer would be -1. Then we will store the answer in an array 
       for the current index.
