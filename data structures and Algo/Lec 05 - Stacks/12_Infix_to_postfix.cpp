/*  ALGORITHM:
    1. Scan the infix expression from left to right.
    2. If the scanned character is an operand, output it.
    3. Else,
        a) If the precedence of the scanned operator is greater 
           than the precedence of the operator in the stack
           (or the stack is empty or the stack contains a ‘(‘ ), 
           push it.
        b) Else, Pop all the operators from the stack which are 
           greater than or equal to in precedence than that of 
           the scanned operator. After doing that Push the 
           scanned operator to the stack. 
           (If you encounter parenthesis while popping then stop 
           there and push the scanned operator in the stack.)
    4. If the scanned character is an ‘(‘, push it to the stack.
    5. If the scanned character is an ‘)’, pop the stack and and output 
       it until a ‘(‘ is encountered, and discard both the parenthesis.
    6. Repeat    2-6 until infix expression is scanned.
    7. Print the output
    8. Pop and output from the stack until it is not empty.

/*  ADDITIONAL POINT:
    In above code, we have converted Infix to Postfix. 
    Now, to convert Infix to Prefix, do the following:

    1. Reverse the infix expression i.e A+B*C will become C*B+A. 
       Note while reversing each ‘(‘ will become ‘)’ and each ‘)’ becomes ‘(‘.
    2. Obtain the postfix expression of the modified expression i.e CB*A+.
    3. Reverse the postfix expression. Hence in our example prefix is +A*BC.
