/*  The stock span problem is a financial problem where we have 
    a series of n daily price quotes for a stock and we need to 
    calculate span of stock’s price for all n days. 
    
    The span Si of the stock’s price on a given day i is defined 
    as the maximum number of consecutive days just before the given day, 
    for which the price of the stock on the current day is less than or 
    equal to its price on the given day.

    For example, if an array of 7 days prices is given as 
    {100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85}, then the span values for corresponding 
    7 days are {1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6}.

    We see that S[i] on day i can be easily computed if we know the closest 
    day preceding i, such that the price is greater than on that day than 
    the price on day i. If such a day exists, let’s call it h(i), otherwise, 
    we define h(i) = -1.
    To implement this logic, we use a stack as an abstract data type to store 
    the days i, h(i), h(h(i)) and so on. When we go from day i-1 to i, we pop 
    the days when the price of the stock was less than or equal to price[i] 
    and then push the value of day i back into the stack.

    Below is the implementation of above method.

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std; 

// Auxiliary Function to print array
void printArray(int arr[], int n) { 
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) 
		cout << arr[i] << " ";
    cout << endl; 
} 

// Main Logic
void calculateSpan(int price[], int n, int S[]) { 
	// Create a stack and push index of first element to it 
	stack<int> st; 
	st.push(0); 

	// Span value of first element is always 1 
	S[0] = 1; 

	// Calculate span values for rest of the elements 
	for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) { 
		// Pop elements from stack while stack is not 
		// empty and top of stack is smaller than price[i] 
		while (!st.empty() && price[st.top()] <= price[i]) 
			st.pop(); 

		// If stack becomes empty, then price[i] is greater 
        // than all elements on left of it, i.e., price[0], 
        // price[1], ..price[i-1]. Else price[i] is greater 
        // than elements after top of stack 
		S[i] = (st.empty()) ? (i + 1) : (i - st.top()); 

		// Push this element to stack 
		st.push(i); 
	} 
} 

/* ------------------- MAIN DRIVER CODE --------------- */
int main() 
{ 
	int price[] = { 10, 4, 5, 90, 120, 80 }; 
	int n = sizeof(price) / sizeof(price[0]); 
	int S[n]; 

	calculateSpan(price, n, S); 
	printArray(S, n); 

	return 0;

    Here is a simple and efficient method, which calcualtes
    span values without using stack but with same idea
